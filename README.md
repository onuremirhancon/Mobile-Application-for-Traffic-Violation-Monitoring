# Starlight Electronic - TrafficGuard Mobile Application

# Overview:
The TrafficGuard Mobile Application is a senior year EE493-4 project aimed at developing a mobile application capable of identifying and notifying users about various traffic infractions, including speeding, running red lights, incorrect overtaking, and more. The application utilizes a combination of sensors, data processing capabilities, and communication technologies to achieve its objectives.

# Features

**Traffic Violation Detection:** The application is designed to detect and identify common traffic offenses such as speeding (vehicle-dependent), running red lights, improper overtaking, and more. Optional features include detecting improper lane changes, illegal parking, illegal turns, driving the wrong way, crossing lanes twice, insufficient distance maintenance, and driving in a crosswalk.

**Data Capture and Storage:** The app captures relevant data associated with traffic violations and securely stores it in a central database or cloud platform. The application ensures efficient data storage, using no more than 10 MB for every minute of recording while gathering data and transmitting it to the central database.

**User-friendly GUI:** The application features a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) that offers statistical analysis of recorded infractions. It allows users to view their own records, with support for at least four separate devices connecting simultaneously to the central unit and database. The system includes both user accounts and an administrator role. Users can only view their own records, and the administrator has the ability to filter violation records based on the type of infraction, license plate, etc.

**Security and Encryption:** Communication within the application is encrypted, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data. The system is designed to meet security standards for handling sensitive information.
